# ClassifyITS

**ClassifyITS** is an R package for quality control, taxonomy assignment, and visualization of fungal OTU representative sequences based on BLAST results.

---

## Features

- Performs QC on user-imported representative sequence FASTA and BLAST results
- Assigns taxonomy using kingdom through species taxon-specific e-values and sequence similarity thresholds
- Outputs an initial CSV taxonomy table for manual inspection, as well as summary graphics and statistics
- [View vignette](vignettes/ClassifyITS.html) for detailed usage instructions and examples
---
## Installation

You can download and install ClassifyITS directly from GitHub using the `devtools` package in R:

```r
# Install devtools if you don't have it yet
install.packages("devtools")

# Install ClassifyITS from GitHub
devtools::install_github("qmoon11/ClassifyITS")

# Load the package
library(ClassifyITS)
```
---

## Prerequisites

This package depends on [Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html), a Bioconductor package for manipulating biological sequences in R.

**Important:**  
Biostrings is _not_ installed automatically via CRAN or `install.packages()`.  
You must install BiocManager and then Biostrings before installing or using ClassifyITS.

```r
# Install BiocManager if needed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install Biostrings
BiocManager::install("Biostrings")

library(Biostrings)
```

## Inspecting taxonomic assingments

It is recommended to carefully examine 1) OTUs that failed the pipeline 2) any OTUs that failed to assign at kingdom level (see list in outputs/intial.assingments.csv) after classifying) as these are likely sequencing errors.
See [Inspection](docs/inspection.md) for information on inspecting results, including:
- How to interpret the `initial_assignments.csv` output file
- Common reasons for failed assignments and how to identify them
- Tips for manual curation of taxonomy assignments (e.g. manually checking BLAST results for fungal OTUs unassigned at phylum or class level)

## About Taxonomic Cutoffs

ClassifyITS uses taxon-specific cutoffs for kingdom through species. At minimum, default cutoffs are provided for all fungal phyla, common classes and orders found in ITS data, and a subset of well studied families, genera, and species. The current list can be seen in `inst/extdata/taxonomy_cutoffs.csv` in the package source code.

You can provide your own custom cutoffs file to fine-tune assignments for your dataset or research question.

If you are knowledgeable in a specific taxonomic group and think ClassifyITS could benefit from modified cutoffs for a particular group, please reach out with proposed cutoffs and supporting citations. Community contributions are welcomed!

> The package is designed so cutoffs can be easily updated as new fungal groups are discovered and taxonomy is refined.

## Cutoff Logic

- **E-values** are favored at higher taxonomic levels (kingdom, phylum) due to variability in sequence similarity and database effects.
- **Percent identity** is favored at lower taxonomic levels (genus, species), where research has established thresholds for ITS similarity within species and genera.

Metabarcoding pipelines are inherently reliant on the idea that percent identity can differentiate species or OTUs. ClassifyITS provides a conservative starting point for taxonomy assignment, with flexibility for manual curation and extension.

## Future Directions and Community Ideas

- Automatic OTU binning with taxonomic-informed cutoffs remains an exciting area for environemental microbiology.
- For example: updating SWARM software to integrate BLAST+taxonomic cutoffs for more accurate OTU clustering could be valuable. I hope someone who is very good at computer can do this!
