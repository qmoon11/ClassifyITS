# ClassifyITS

**ClassifyITS** is an R package for quality control, taxonomy assignment, and visualization of fungal OTU representative sequences based on BLAST results.

---

## Features

- Performs QC on user-imported representative sequence FASTA and BLAST results
- Assigns taxonomy using kingdom through species taxon-specific e-values and sequence similarity thresholds
- Outputs an initial CSV taxonomy table for manual inspection, as well as summary graphics and statistics

---
## Installation

You can download and install ClassifyITS directly from GitHub using the `devtools` package in R:

```r
# Install devtools if you don't have it yet
install.packages("devtools")

# Install ClassifyITS from GitHub
devtools::install_github("qmoon11/ClassifyITS")

# Load the package
library(ClassifyITS)
```
---

## Prerequisites

This package depends on [Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html), a Bioconductor package for manipulating biological sequences in R.

**Important:**  
Biostrings is _not_ installed automatically via CRAN or `install.packages()`.  
You must install BiocManager and then Biostrings before installing or using ClassifyITS.

```r
# Install BiocManager if needed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install Biostrings
BiocManager::install("Biostrings")

library(Biostrings)
```

## Inspecting taxonomic assingments

It is recommended to carefully examine 1) OTUs that failed the pipeline 2) any OTUs that failed to assign at kingdom level (see list in outputs/intial.assingments.csv) after classifying) as these are likely sequencing errors.
See [Inspection](inspection.md) for information on inspecting results, including:
- How to interpret the `initial_assignments.csv` output file
- Common reasons for failed assignments and how to identify them
- Tips for manual curation of taxonomy assignments (e.g. manually checking BLAST results for fungal OTUs unassigned at phylum or class level)
