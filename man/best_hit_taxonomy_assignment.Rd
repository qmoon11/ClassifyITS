\title{Hierarchical best-hit taxonomy assignment with per-rank fallback rule}
\usage{
best_hit_taxonomy_assignment(blast_qc, cutoffs_long, defaults)
}
\arguments{
\item{blast_qc}{A data.frame of BLAST results for query sequences, must include columns for taxonomic ranks and alignment statistics.}

\item{cutoffs_long}{A data.frame specifying per-rank cutoffs for assignment. Must include columns 'rank', 'cutoff_type', and 'cutoff_value'.}

\item{defaults}{A named list of default cutoff values for each rank, used as fallback if no matching cutoff found.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing hierarchical taxonomy assignment for each query sequence.
}
\description{
Pass ONLY those OTUs that haven't been assigned already!
For each rank, if the best e-value hit is undefined and the second-best hit is defined
and at least 60% as good, use the second-best hit's value for that rank.
