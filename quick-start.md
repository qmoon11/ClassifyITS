## Quick Start

Once you have installed the package and Biostrings, and prepared your BLAST results as described in Data Preparation, you can run the assignment pipeline with just a few lines:

    ITS_taxonomy <- ITS_assignment(
        blast_file = "input/blast_results.tsv",            # Path to your BLAST .TSV file
        rep_fasta = "input/representative_seqs.fasta"      # Path to your FASTA file
    )

You can also specify optional parameters:

    ITS_taxonomy <- ITS_assignment(
        blast_file = "input/blast_results.tsv",
        rep_fasta = "input/representative_seqs.fasta",
        cutoffs_file = NULL,       # Optional: custom taxonomy cutoffs file
        cutoff_fraction = 0.6,     # Optional: fraction for alignment length QC
        n_cutoff = 1,              # Optional: percent N cutoff
        outdir = "outputs"         # Optional: output directory
    )

- `cutoffs_file`: Path to a custom taxonomy cutoffs CSV file (see extdata in package).
- `cutoff_fraction`: Fraction of median alignment length for BLAST QC filter.
- `n_cutoff`: Maximum percent N bases (ambiguous bases) allowed in any sequence.
- `outdir`: Output directory for results (defaults to "outputs").

The function returns a list including the main taxonomy assignment table, QC information, and summary figures. See documentation for advanced workflow options.
